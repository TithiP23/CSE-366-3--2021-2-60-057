# Genetic Algorithm - Robot Resource Optimization

## Overview
This repository contains files for solving a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to optimize robot task assignments. The main goal is to reduce completion time, balance workload distribution, and assign tasks to robots with different efficiencies and priorities in an efficient manner.

## Files
- **Assignment2_Genetic Algorithm - Robot Resource Optimization_Source_Code.ipynb**: Main source file for running the process.
- **Assignment 2_Genetic Algorithm - Robot Resource Optimization_Report.pdf**: Contains the report of the assignment.
- **README.md**: This file, provides an overview of the assignment repository.

## Requirements
- Jupyter Notebook
- matplotlib
- NumPy

## How to Use:

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook file.

2. Run the main source file.

3. View the optimization results:
    - Observe the optimal work assignments in the visualization that was produced.
    - Review the findings and information shown in the console output.

4. A report of the assignment is also added.
