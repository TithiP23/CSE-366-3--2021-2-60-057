# Enhanced Dynamic Robot Movement Simulation 

This project simulates a robot navigating through a grid with obstacles, using A* and Uniform Cost Search (UCS) algorithms to find the most efficient path.

## Overview

The code simulates a robot navigating a grid with obstacles to reach a goal. It uses A* and Uniform Cost Search algorithms for pathfinding and manages the robot's battery usage during movement. Visualization features display the path and battery status.

## Files

- **Assignment_1_Enhanced_Dynamic_Robot_Movement_Simulation_Source_Code.ipynb**: This is a notebook that shows how a robot moves around in a space with blocks. It talks about the robot's actions and how it decides where to go using two methods called A* and UCS. It also has the main part you run to see how the robot moves using these methods.

- **Assignment 1_ Enhanced Dynamic Robot Movement Simulation_Report.pdf**: This is a report about the assignment.

- **README.md**: This document gives a quick summary of what's in the project.

## You'll Need

- Jupyter Notebook and some libraries like matplotlib to run the notebook.

## How to Use

1. Open the notebook file.
2. There will be steps to choose between A* or UCS methods and to start the simulation. Follow these to watch how the robot tries to reach its goal while considering its battery life.
3. For more details, you can read the assignment report included in the folder.
