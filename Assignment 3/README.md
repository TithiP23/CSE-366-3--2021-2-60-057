# Computer Vision Assignment: Image Classification with Custom CNN and MobileNetV2

This project involves developing and training deep-learning models for image classification tasks. We focus on implementing a Custom CNN Model and MobileNetV2 to classify images into predefined categories using a provided dataset.

## Overview
The project aims to classify images into predefined categories using deep learning models. We implemented and trained a Custom CNN model and MobileNetV2, comparing their performance based on accuracy, training time, and complexity. Data preprocessing steps included data augmentation and normalization to improve model performance and prevent overfitting.
## Dataset
- The dataset used for this assignment can be accessed at [Mendeley Data](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/brfgw46wzb/1). It contains multiple images classified into different categories.
